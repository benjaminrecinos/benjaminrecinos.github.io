# Horiseon

Refactoring Horiseon's existing code to make it more accessible to people.

The goal of this project was to refactor the code so it can benefit the page. Many changes were made to the code without changing its appearance, such as adding semantic elements to help with SEO, organizing the code with comments, and consolidating the code to avoid duplicates.
